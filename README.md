Russian AI Cup 2017 (15th in final, 9th in sandbox rating)

This is my solution of Russian AI Cup 2017 problem. The task was to create an artificial intelligence (strategy) to control a large amount of units (vehicles) in a special game world. The rules are made in such way that actions that are available to strategy are similar to actions in common games of RTS genre.

Im my solution I used such algorithms as potential (vector) fields and A*.
